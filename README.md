# Rails forms

The project is part of a series of projects to be completed by students of [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/ "The Global School for Remote Software Developers!").

In this mini-project, we explored ways to build forms in rails app. We started with vanilla HTML, then used form_tag but finally ended with form_for.

## Technologies

- Ruby 2.6.3
- Rails 5.2.3

## Usage

> Clone the repository to your local machine

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/ebukaume/re-former.git
```

> cd into the directory

```sh
$ cd re-former
$ bundle install
$ rails db:migrate
```

> You can then drop into rails console to explore the models

```sh
$ cd rails s
$ open http://localhost:3000/users/new
```
